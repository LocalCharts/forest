\title{About the LocalCharts forest}

\p{This is a place for writing in the [spirit of LocalCharts](https://www.localcharts.org/t/localcharts-is-live/5714) with high-quality mathematical typesetting. To do this, we use [forester](http://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-005P.xml) to build the [source](https://github.com/LocalCharts/forest) of this website, and then embed comments from the [LocalCharts discourse instance](https://www.localcharts.org). Forester satisfies more of the [desiderata for an adequate scientific publishing platform](https://www.localcharts.org/t/desiderata-for-an-adequate-scientific-publishing-platform/11367) than almost any other tool that I've considered using for a similar purpose, which is funny because it came out of [Jon Sterling having a fairly similar thought process](http://www.jonmsterling.com/tfmt-000E.xml).}
